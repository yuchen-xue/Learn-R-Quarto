## About a Quarto Project

Quarto is a successor of R markdown. A Quarto project is defined by a `_quarto.yml` file and usually some Quarto markdown `.qmd` files. It can conveniently convert `.qmd` files into website, presentation or other formats. The output format is defined inside the `_quarto.yml` file. Multiple output format is allowed.

Quarto projects can be created and managed by [Quarto CLI tool](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
