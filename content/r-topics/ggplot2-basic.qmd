## Expansion

For charts like scatter plots, this gives us a nicer look because points are not located at the edge of the plotting area this way. To know more about this topic, check the following websites.

## Miscellaneous

### Does the order of the function call matters? 

Usually it doens't. Only the order of the *`geom`* functions (e.g. `geom_abline()`) may influence the result.

### How to add a photo for $x$ tick?

Use [`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/)
