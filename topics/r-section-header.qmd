## Insert a section using shortcut 

::: {.callout-note title="The shortcut for inserting a section"}
CTRL + SHIFT + R
:::

Inside the pop-up window, you can type your desired section heading name
This method is preferred because R Studio will automatically fill the rest of the lines with dashes

```{r}
# Insert a section using shortcut ----------------------------------------- 
```

## Insert a section manually

At least *4 dashes* behind a comment is recognized as an indicator for a section

```{r}
# Insert a section manually ----
```
